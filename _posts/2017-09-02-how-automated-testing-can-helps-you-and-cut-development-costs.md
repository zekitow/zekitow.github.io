Automated testing is a great way to ensure software quality. The TDD (Test driven development) leads the developers to create simple and maintainable code while BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is responsible to test the connected parts of the software, that is, it's behavior or domain.

Both methods can reduce the incidence of bugs in a production environment and saves a lot of money and time over manual testing.


## But what is TDD?

TDD is basically a process of writing automated tests to ensure that code works before write the implementation.

There exists 3 main steps which is red, green and refactor. The developer writes the test and runs it before create the implementation (red), then writes the implementation and runs it again until it pass (green). if needed, the developer can refactory the code (refactor). These cycle should be repeated as the developer builds the software.


## What is BDD?

BDD is basically the process of writing test scenarios defined by business requirements and ensure that the software behaves as expected. The BDD encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. Let's see how it should look like using [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby):

```cucumber
Feature: Working hours approval
  As a manager I should be able to approve the working hours of the employees of my team.

Background:
  Given I'm logged in as manager user
    And the employee "John" have "3" working hour records waiting for approval

Scenario: Manager should be able to see the pending approval working hours of my team
  Given I click on "Time tracking" on menu
   When I click on "Pending approvals" link
   Then I should see "3" records marked as "pending" being "John" the author
```

Note that the feature can be used as a documentation and have the pre-conditions (**given**), actions (**when**) and assertions (**then**), so anyone can quickly understand whats the behavior of each screen of the software.
