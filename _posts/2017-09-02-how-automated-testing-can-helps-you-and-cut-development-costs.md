Automated testing is a great way to ensure software quality. The TDD (Test driven development) leads the developers to create simple and maintainable code while BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is responsible to test the connected parts of the software, that is, it's behavior or domain.

Both methods can reduce the incidence of bugs in a production environment and saves a lot of money and time over manual testing.


## But what is TDD?

TDD is basically a process of wrting automated tests to ensure that code works before write the implementation.

There exists 3 main steps which is red, green and refactor. The developer writes the test and runs it before create the implementation (red), then writes the implementation and runs it again until it pass (green). if needed, the developer can refactory the code (refactor). These cycle should be repeated as the developer builds the software.
