I’m a Homebrewer and professional software engineer since 2006 and I’ve worked deeply with some different technologies over 11 years including Java, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Angular, HTML, CSS.

I’m also worked with different methodologies and tools such as Scrum, Waterfall, XP (extreme programming), TDD (testing driven development), BDD (behavior driven development) and CI (continuous integration) and I had provided workshops about the subjects inside my clients and companies there I've worked for.

Nowadays I’m working as a freelancer in Sorocaba, Brazil with startups, digital agencies and different industries.

I’m passionate about technologies that makes me more productive and can save time and money inside the companies.
